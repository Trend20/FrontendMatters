app
This directory is where the Next.js App Router is configured.
layout.tsx: This file defines the root layout for the application, which can include components like the header and footer.
page.tsx: This is the root page component, which could render the home page or a list of featured blog posts.
about/page.tsx: This file defines the page component for the "About" section of the application.
blog/[slug]/page.tsx: This file defines the page component for rendering an individual blog post, where [slug] is a dynamic segment representing the unique identifier for each blog post.
blog/loading.tsx: This file defines a loading state component to be displayed while the blog data is being fetched.
blog/not-found.tsx: This file defines a component to be displayed when a requested blog post is not found.
contact/page.tsx: This file defines the page component for the "Contact" section of the application.

components

    This directory contains reusable React components for different parts of the application, such as the header, footer, blog cards, blog lists, comment sections, and search bars.

lib

    prisma.ts: This file exports the Prisma client instance, which is used to interact with the database.
    helpers.ts: This file contains utility functions used throughout the application, such as date formatting, string manipulation, etc.

types

    This directory contains TypeScript type definitions for different data models, such as blog.ts for blog post data and comment.ts for comment data.

styles

    globals.css: This file contains global styles applied throughout the application.
    Other style files can be added as needed for specific components or pages.

prisma

    schema.prisma: This file defines the data models and relations for the Prisma ORM, specifying the structure of the MongoDB database.

public

    This directory contains static assets like images, favicons, etc.

Configuration Files

    .env: This file stores environment variables used throughout the application, such as the MongoDB connection string.
    next.config.js: This file is used for configuring Next.js-specific settings, like custom server configurations or plugins.
    postcss.config.js: This file configures PostCSS for processing Tailwind CSS utilities.
    tailwind.config.js: This file contains the configuration for Tailwind CSS, including custom utility classes and plugin settings.
    package.json: This file lists the project dependencies and scripts for development and production builds.

### Data Flow

    When a user visits the blog application, Next.js handles the routing and renders the appropriate page component based on the URL.
    Page components can fetch data from the MongoDB database using the Prisma ORM client.
    Blog posts, comments, and other data are retrieved from the database and passed down to the respective components for rendering.
    Components like BlogList, BlogDetail, and CommentSection receive the data as props and display the content accordingly.
    User interactions like creating new blog posts or submitting comments trigger updates to the database through Prisma queries or mutations.
    The updated data is then reflected in the UI when the corresponding components re-render with the new data.
